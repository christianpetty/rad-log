# Time

Log private, offline notes with prefixed timestamps. Also useful for taking real-time notes during testing.

Type your note and press enter/return to save it to the history with a timestamp. Javascript is required to use this app, but no external calls are performed. History is saved locally in session storage and is wiped after closing the tab.

Clipboard copies are tab-delimitated.
